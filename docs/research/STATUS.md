# Current research state

Reviewed 2026-11-01 against fork `main` through
[PR #54](https://github.com/jekkiechan/more-than-a-hack-2027/pull/54) and the completed
[decoder search](../../experiments/DECODER_SEARCH_V2.md), including the completed
[subsecond-team comparison](../../experiments/DENSE_SHORT_TEAM_V1.md) and the
completed source-head evidence on open [PR #47](https://github.com/jekkiechan/more-than-a-hack-2027/pull/47).
Check newer merged/open PRs before current-results advice. Detailed historical
results belong in [EXPERIMENTS](EXPERIMENTS.md) and the linked reports.

## Adopted package

`joint_gru_sn_dense_ensemble_v1`: two width-96 conditional H/A GRUs with
fine-tuned D paths, trained with dense SoccerNet-GAR touch-stream silver labels.
The [baseline guide](../../experiments/BASELINE.md) owns the package, evidence,
restore and inference commands; the active manifest and decision policy are
linked there. The user explicitly approved promotion despite missing the +.01
clean spell screen. The frozen failed screen and closed public diagnostic remain
unchanged. Full-match organizer performance and independent broadcast confirmation
are unknown. All five development matches have prior exposure; feed-like stress
is synthetic, and dense GAR labels are derived silver labels.

## Next work

1. The [118-arm decoder refinement](../../experiments/DECODER_REFINEMENT_V3.md)
   improves external clean/feed-like spell to .652958/.511065, and a non-Viterbi
   anchor segmenter reaches .649962/.508516. Both beat .647215/.505811;
   provider guards pass, but the +.01 screen fails. The explicitly requested
   one-time public diagnostic scores both the previous split-cost winner
   and the selected refinement at .575000 versus saved .630303. Keep `r069`
   as the strongest external candidate: both seeds and every provider gain in
   clean and feed-like spell. The public window is diagnostic and does not veto
   that external ranking. The deployed manifest is unchanged pending a separate
   explicit promotion decision; no public-driven tuning follows. Independent
   dense evidence remains the next confirmation priority. The [earlier 134-arm study](../../experiments/DECODER_SEARCH_V2.md)
   is development evidence, not a confirmed competition improvement.
2. The [subsecond-team follow-up](../../experiments/DENSE_SHORT_TEAM_V1.md)
   is complete: six fixed 2× H/A-weighted fits and a fixed 50/50 ensemble blend
   both reduce clean/feed-like spell F1. Short-team errors improve marginally
   clean but worsen under stress. Exact sampler replay shows only 0.09–0.10%
   of sampled GAR H/A rows qualify. Stop duration/blend-weight sweeps on these
   exposed matches; prioritize targeted external supervision and independent
   dense evaluation. This follows the negative
   [targeted dense comparisons](../../experiments/DENSE_TARGETED_FOLLOWUPS.md).
   The adopted model and closed organizer gates remain unchanged.
3. The source-specific head comparison on open PR #47 is completed and negative:
   retain the shared dense heads. Its provider-definition audit supports holding
   possession through contested touches; it does not justify rebuilding GAR
   labels. Whole-stoppage model comparison remains blocked on continuous aligned
   tracking. See the [PR #47 report](https://github.com/jekkiechan/more-than-a-hack-2027/blob/6e93eb2218a533b8017ff50f284f655021eec9e6/experiments/SOURCE_CONDITIONED_HEADS_REPORT.md).
4. Fresh external dense possession evidence remains optional stronger
   confirmation. The [independent-data search](../../experiments/INDEPENDENT_DATA_SEARCH.md)
   acquired a SoccerTrack panorama sample; the
   [blind annotation proposal](../../experiments/SHORT_SPELL_NEXT.md) still needs
   independent H/A/D/X labels. Event-interpolated ball paths are not measured
   observations. Sample acquisition and GAR silver labels do not supply
   independent confirmation.

[settled directions](EXPERIMENTS.md#settled-directions).

## Artifacts and open work

- **Decoder refinement:** 118 arms and the fixed public diagnostic are complete;
  `r069` remains the strongest external candidate. Private PR #12 has 432
  fresh-restore hash-verified entries. Site version 14 is published with external-first
  interpretation and desktop/mobile QA. The user authorized this publication and
  future experiment-report updates to the same existing restricted audience.
  [Report and receipts](../../experiments/DECODER_REFINEMENT_V3.md#delivery-and-reproduction-state).

- **Decoder search delivery:** code/results merged in PR #54; private PR #11
  has 295 remotely restored, hash-verified entries. The experimental full CSV
  passes format validation. Research site version 12 was published after explicit
  user approval; the previous approval blocker is resolved. [Report and receipts](../../experiments/DECODER_SEARCH_V2.md#artifact-and-site-delivery).

- **Spell-F1 postprocessing (2026-11-01):** fixed posterior expected-spell-F1
  decoding completed all 45 paired cells. Ensemble clean/feed-like changes
  −.004235/−.002601; both individual seeds also decline. Retain cost-3 Viterbi;
  no sample-budget or seed sweep follows. The result is included in published research site version 12. [Report](../../experiments/SPELL_MBR_V1.md).

- **Postprocessing runtime (2026-11-01):** optional decoder reduces synthetic
  199,319-frame decoding time by 16%, with independent numerical parity tests.
  Not integrated or promoted; real-input parity and end-to-end timing remain.
  Included in published research site version 12.
  [Report](../../experiments/POSTPROCESSING_RUNTIME_V1.md).

- **Subsecond team attribution:** six fits and the fixed blend are complete;
  neither improves the adopted ensemble. Code/results are merged in PR #50.
  Private [mtah-data PR #9](https://github.com/jekkiechan/mtah-data/pull/9)
  delivers 122 verified archive entries and 118 successfully restored mapped
  files. The restricted research site is published as version 11.
  [Report and delivery receipts](../../experiments/DENSE_SHORT_TEAM_V1.md#reproduction-and-artifact-state).

- **Targeted dense follow-ups:** all 12 fits and three comparisons are complete;
  reconstructed controls reproduce saved clean/feed-like scores within 3 × 10⁻¹¹.
  Input byte-hash differences remain documented. Private archive delivery is complete: all 338 entries verified remotely and
  235 unique original-path files restored without mismatches.
  [mtah-data PR #8](https://github.com/jekkiechan/mtah-data/pull/8);
  [coordinated report](../../experiments/DENSE_TARGETED_FOLLOWUPS.md).

- **Dense deployment:** private [mtah-data PR #7](https://github.com/jekkiechan/mtah-data/pull/7)
  is merged at `19ee280`. This session restored and verified all four versioned
  checkpoint hashes and reproduced the sealed full CSV from raw ATD inputs.
  [Submission receipt](../../experiments/dense_submission_audit_v1/report.json).
  The deployment package does not include the original dense research fold
  checkpoints or their probability arrays.
- **Previous capacity deployment:** verified remote recovery is complete;
  [receipt](../../experiments/results/baseline_soccernet_capacity_remote_artifacts.json).
  This does not establish remote availability of every research fold checkpoint.
- **Matched training follow-up:** completed, no upgrade;
  [report](../../experiments/SOCCERNET_FOLLOWUP.md) owns replay and artifact state.
  Its reconstructed reference is distinct from the later exact deployment restore.
- **Open evidence:** [PR #35](https://github.com/jekkiechan/more-than-a-hack-2027/pull/35)
  contains completed label-free gap, possession-rate and adaptation comparisons,
  all reported no go against the former combined-objective baseline. It is
  unmerged (head `143d010`), not evidence against the new dense recipe.
- Draft PRs #8, #11, #13, #16, #18 and #25 remain open at review. Find pinned
  evidence in the index and inspect live heads before resuming. A draft's
  presence does not imply its code is absent from later merged dependencies.

Update this file when adoption, priorities or blockers change. Put scorecards,
per-study receipts and historical decisions in their reports/index, rather than
appending another completed-study handoff here.
